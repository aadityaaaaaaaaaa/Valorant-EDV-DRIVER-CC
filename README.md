## 🧠 **Overview**

**VALORANT Tactical Hack Framework** is a **conceptual and educational project** focused on exploring the architecture, UI/UX, and logic behind tactical game overlays and analysis tools.

---

## ⚡ **Features**

- 🎯 **Aim Assistance Simulation:** A system that suggests optimal target areas to focus on based on game data (not affecting in-game behavior).
- 👁 **ESP-like Visualization (Mock Data):** A concept of showing enemy positions based on simulated game data.
- 🧭 **Player and Map Intelligence Layer:** Providing strategic insights into where the player might be vulnerable or where teammates need help.
- 🖥 **External Overlay Architecture:** Designing an external window to display key information while not modifying the game itself.
- 🎨 **VALORANT-Inspired Neon UI:** A user interface mimicking the neon aesthetic from VALORANT, focusing on clean lines and intuitive design for efficiency.
- ⚙ **Modular & Scalable Framework:** Expandable tools that can simulate various overlays such as tactical maps, resource tracking, and round analysis.
- ⚡ **Smooth Animations & Low-Latency Rendering:** Ensuring that all visual data is provided without causing distractions or hindering gameplay.

---

## 🖼 **UI Preview**

- **Neon Red / Black / White Color Palette**  
- **Sharp, geometric design** with clean typography.  
- **Competitive HUD Layout** that prioritizes user control and visualization.  
- **Neon Highlights & Glow Effects** that provide clarity on important info without cluttering the screen.

---

## 🛠 **How It Works **

1. **External Analysis Layer:** The tool operates outside of the game to gather publicly available information (e.g., map layout, team composition, and individual stats).
2. **Simulation of Tactical Feedback:** Data-driven suggestions on player positioning and decision-making will appear through an overlay, providing a real-time tactical map, but without direct interaction with the game code.


---

## 📦 **System Requirements**


- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later
- **Processor:** Intel i3 or equivalent
- **RAM:** 4 GB or more
- **Available Storage:** At least 500 MB
- **Display:** High-resolution monitor to see the full range of overlay data.
